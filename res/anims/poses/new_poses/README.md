About this directory
========


This directory contains newer poses which we have the full sources for, Blend and BVH, or a source file describing how to recreate the pose in another posing program.

Anim files may be placed into the Anim folder, but only if they are thoroughly tested to produce the same animation as their BVH counterpart.


Note about Blend files: These will require Blender, and Avastar for properly being able to export the animations.

To export a BVH from a Blend file, open it in blender and go to the render tab. The set the properties near the bottom, and export it with the $action root node.
